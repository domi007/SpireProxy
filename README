This project aims to create a fully automated SpireProxy server.

BE WARNED!
DRAGONS ARE AHEAD!
Meaning:
-this code comes without any warranty
-this code is extremely dirty, but HOPEFULLY doesn't contain any bugs

If you think you can't live with the feeling you are running dirty code, then modify it yourself, you are free to do that!

VERY FIRST TIME USERS:
-1. Run dependencies.sh to get all the programs needed to run the server:
sudo su
./dependencies.sh


FIRST TIME USERS:
0. Set up a fakeDNS server. Configure the script attached (fakedns.rb) like th$

$R = Resolv::DNS.new(:nameserver =>"GET YOUR NAMESERVER HERE")
Name = Resolv::DNS::Name

RubyDNS::run_server(:listen => [[:udp, "0.0.0.0", 53]]) do
    # For this exact address record, return an IP address
    match("guzzoni.apple.com", :A) do |transaction|
        transaction.respond!("GET YOUR IP HERE")


GET YOUR NAMESERVER HERE = put in a DNS server that is valid, if you don't know what to do,$
Always check your /etc/resolv.conf if it doesn't work, if you have an entry like this:
nameserver SOME-IP-ADDRESS
Then put SOME-IP-ADDRESS in the file mentioned above.

GET YOUR IP HERE = put in your server's IP address (get it from ifconfig)

Run the server like this:
sudo ruby fakedns.rb

Leave it running!

Now go into your iPhone's settings (both 4/3GS/iPod Touch 4G AND 4S) -> WiFi -> little blue arrow next to your WiFi's name -> DNS
Put in your server's IP address into DNS

1. You need to create your own certificates by using the certs.sh bash script and install the ca.crt on your device (email it to yourself or run a webserver and host the file there)
1/a. You also need to copy the server.passless files (both) to every directory here (YES EVERY SINGLE FOLDER!, even the one that contains README)
2. You need to run AuthGrabber first to obtain the following data:
XAceHostKey
AssistantIDKey
SpeechIDKey
THESE values ARE CONSTANT, and DON'T CHANGE EVERY 24 hours, SO YOU NEED TO GRAB THEM ONLY ONCE!

Then to run the auth grabber, just do 'sudo ./cache.sh' (no quotes)

All auth data is written to ./auths as acehosts0.txt, acehosts1.txt etc.
From these files you can copy and paste their values into SiriAuth/siriAuth.rb:

XAceHostKey = "PUT IT IN HERE"

AssistantIDKey = "PUT IT IN HERE"

SpeechIDKey = "PUT IT IN HERE"

After that, you can proceed!
3. If you have done everything right, now you have:
-a fake DNS server running
-edited siriAuth.rb and pastes in the constant values

So now, there is not much left:
a; run eventMachineGuzzoni.rb like this:
cd Cracking-Siri
sudo ruby eventMachineGuzzoni.rb

b; run siriAuth.rb server in a different console:
cd SiriAuth
sudo ruby start.rb

Now you should have a server listening on port 443 (this will handle all 4S reuests and capture the key you need), and a server listening on port 3000 (could be changed by editing siriAuth.rb)

Now go into your iPhone's settings, scroll down and find Spire, then enter for server:
https://guzzzoni.apple.com:3000

If your 4S provides you keys (ask the 4S user to use Siri at least twice a day!) you can use Siri on yor iPhone 4/3GS or iPod Touch 4G without any problems


All credit goes down to these people:

 -Applidium for creating Cracking-Siri
 -plamoni for using Cracking-Siri to create SiriProxy
 -stantheripper for creating SiriAuth

Thank you for being awesome!
